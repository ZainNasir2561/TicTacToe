# TicTacToe

Although a Tic-Tac-Toe project might seem somewhat minuscule to the average person,

I decided to use this project to hone my skills in various programming concepts regarding 

components, conditionals, and states. 


This is a great project for users to revise and review basic, but fundamental, programming concepts!

And if you'd like to run this code for yourself, 

simply, run npm install!
