# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project repository! This project is a classic yet insightful test of my understanding and application of React components, conditionals, and state management. Despite its simplicity, Tic Tac Toe offers a great platform to revisit and solidify fundamental programming concepts.

# Project Description
Tic Tac Toe is a timeless game that has stood the test of time, captivating players of all ages. This project is designed to bring the classic game to the digital age, utilizing React for its implementation. It's a perfect opportunity to explore React's capabilities in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.

# Key Features
- State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the game state, including the board configuration and the current player's turn.
- Conditionals for Game Logic: Implements conditional rendering and logic to determine the game's outcome, such as checking for a win, a draw, or the next player's turn.
- Components for Modularity: Structures the game into reusable components, such as the game board and individual cells, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

# Technical Insights
- Game Board Representation: Represents the game board as a 3x3 array, allowing for dynamic updates and rendering of the game state 4.
- Player Representation: Defines players with symbols and names, facilitating a clear distinction between the human player and the computer player 4.
- Game Logic Implementation: Incorporates logic to handle player moves, check for win conditions, and manage the game's flow, showcasing my ability to apply conditional logic effectively 4.
